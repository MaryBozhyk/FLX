      shortDescription: 'The dominant UK services sector grew only slightly in August, an influential survey shows',
      content: 'The UK is at risk of slipping into recession, according to a closely watched survey of industry managers. <br/> The dominant services sector grew only slightly in August, the purchasing managers\' index (PMI) from IHS Markit/CIPS suggests. <br/> "The lack of any meaningful growth... raises the likelihood that the UK economy is slipping into recession," said IHS economist Chris Williamson. <br/> The construction and manufacturing sectors also shrunk in August. <br/> The services sector accounts for 80% of the UK economy. <br/> According to IHS\' survey, the sector barely expanded in August, achieving a score of 50.6 - down from 51.4 in July. Anything above 50 marks growth, while a lower number indicates a contraction. <br/> However, the figure including manufacturing and construction was 49.7, the second contraction for the private sector in three months. <br/> IHS Markit said Brexit uncertainty and higher business costs were to blame. <br/> "While the current downturn remains only mild overall, the summer\'s malaise could intensify as we move into autumn," added Mr Williamson. <br/> UK economy shrinks for the first time since 2012 <br/> Factory output \'falls at fastest pace since 2012\' <br/> Between April and June the UK\'s economy contracted for the first time since 2012. A recession occurs when the economy contracts in two consecutive quarters. <br/> According to IHS Markit, UK firms are hiring and taking on new clients at a slower pace as they try to gauge whether the government will quit the European Union without a deal at the end of October. <br/> Service-based firms, which include hotels, restaurants, banks and insurers, are also seeing profit margins squeezed by rising staff wages , fuel costs and utility bills, the survey found. <br/> \'Pinch of salt\' <br/> This measure also slipped into negative growth in 2016 following the Brexit referendum and in 2012, around the time of the European sovereign debt crisis. <br/> The numbers should be taken with a pinch of salt, said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. <br/> "PMIs are excessively influenced by business sentiment and have given a misleadingly weak steer during the past 12 months of heightened political uncertainty. Note too that they exclude the retail and government sectors, which still are growing," he said. <br/> He expects a 0.4% gain for the economy in the July to September period, assuming a deal is struck with the EU ahead of the UK\'s departure.',

      content: ' Pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have been turning to a new app to communicate - one that does not use the internet and is therefore harder for the Chinese authorities to trace. <br/> Bridgefy is based on Bluetooth and allows protesters to communicate with each other without internet connection. <br/> Downloads are up almost 4,000% in the past two months, according to measurement firm Apptopia. <br/> Texts, email and messaging app WeChat are all monitored by the Chinese state. <br/> Bridgefy uses a mesh network, which links together users\' devices allowing people to chat with others even if they are in a different part of the city, by hopping on other users\' phones until the message reaches the intended person. <br/> The range from phone to phone is within 100m (330ft). <br/> The app was designed by a start-up based in San Francisco and has previously been used in places where wi-fi or traditional networks struggle to work, such as large music or sporting events. <br/> Speaking to Forbes, co-founder Jorge Rios said of the spike in use in Hong Kong: "People are using it to organise themselves and to stay safe, without having to depend on an internet connection." <br/> The BBC understands that protesters are turning to Bridgefy in case the internet is cut off, or the so-called Great Firewall of China, which censors some parts of the web on the mainland, is instigated in Hong Kong. <br/> A similar app, FireChat, has already been used in previous protests in Hong Kong and also in Taiwan, Iran and Iraq.',

      heading:'Indian government asks Twitter to remove accounts ‘spreading rumours’ about Kashmir',
      shortDescription: 'With the communication blackout inside Kashmir, netizens elsewhere resorted to Twitter to speak out against India\'s revocation of the region\'s autonomous status.',
      content: 'With the communication blackout inside Kashmir, netizens elsewhere resorted to Twitter to share the news. This has prompted the Indian government to go after some Twitter accounts it accused of spreading false news in relation to its controversial Kashmir move. <br/> On August 12, local media reported that the Indian home ministry had asked Twitter to ”suspend” eight  accounts for spreading ”misinformation and rumours to disturb peace and calm” in Kashmir. The government accused the accounts of “engaging in an anti-India campaign on Kashmir and Article 370” in violation of India\'s Information Technology Act. Section 69A of India\'s IT Act bans content deemed threatening to ”the security of the State, the sovereignty, integrity or defense of India”. <br/> In fact, the Indian government and its supporters have been denouncing what little information is emerging about the situation in Kashmir as ”false” or as propaganda operations run by Pakistan\'s Spy Agency or its Army. India has long been accusing Pakistan of aiding militants to infiltrate Kashmir to conduct subversive activities. Pakistan responded to the revocation of Kashmir\'s autonomous status by suspending trade with India and downgrading ties with India. <br/> For example, the BBC\'s coverage was questioned after it reported on August 9 that the police opened fire and used tear gas to disperse protesters in Soura, Srinagar. The Indian government said that the protest never took place and trolls took to Twitter to attack the BBC and accused it of spreading ”fake news”. While the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), the Jammu and Kashmir Police, and other security agencies have been warning Indian social media users not to believe in ”fake news” spread on social media. ,br/> The list of Twitter accounts targeted for removal includes the accounts of Islamabad based Kashmiri activist Madiha Shakil Khan (@Red4Kashmir), Pakistani journalist, writer and TV news anchorperson Arshad Sharif (@arsched), British freelance journalist Mary Scully (@mscully94), and Voice of Kashmir (@kashmir787), which is one of the accounts of Pakistan based citizen media site Our Voice Matter. In the aftermath of India\'s revocation of Article 370, these accounts have been tweeting to denounce Indian  policies and practices in Kashmir and in support of the region\'s autonomy. Twitter took no actions against these accounts, and at the time of publication the four accounts were still accessible from India. <br/> Twitter maintains a “country withheld” policy, under which the company may censor specific tweets or accounts in just one country, in response to a government order proving that the tweets are illegal under its local laws. Indian authorities repeatedly send removal requests to Twitter under this policy. According to the company\'s Transparency Report, in the second half of 2018, Twitter received 667 removal requests affecting 2,228 accounts from Indian authorities. The platform complied with 2 percent of those requests. <br/> According to media reports, the four other Twitter accounts targeted for removal by the Indian government were @sageelaniii,@sadaf2k19, @RiazKha613 and @RiazKha723. The @sageelaniii  account was tweeting under the name of Syed Ali Geelani, a Kashmiri separatist leader, although it was reported not to be his actual account. The accounts of @sageelaniii and @sadaf2k19 were suspended by Twitter for violating the platform\'s rules, although it was not clear which rule. A search for the account @RiazKha613 turned no results, while a search for @RiazKha723 showed an account that ”doesn\'t exist”. <br/> When contacted by Outlook India, a news outlet, Twitter said that they do not content on the deletion of individual accounts. According to a Twitter spokesperson: <br/> We do not content on individual accounts for privacy and security reasons. Legal requests made to Twitter are published bi-annually in our Twitter Transparency Report. <br/> As access to internet and phone networks remains suspended in Kashmir, Kashmiris elsewhere in the world and those supporting their struggle for autonomy, have continued to take to Twitter and other social media platforms to express their solidarity. While the Indian government can request Twitter to censor accounts that violate its laws, it remains to be seen how many of those it will eventually be able to silence. <br/> ”There are still many powerful voices speaking out on Twitter & FB against Indian colonialism & occupation & #StandingWithKashmir”, Mary Scully, whose account is among the eight accounts targeted for removal, wrote on Facebook.',

      heading: 'A Brazilian journalist uses deepfake to make political satire',
      shortDescription: 'They are not made to forge a reality, but a certain situation, with humour and in a critical way.',
      content: 'In May 2019, a video showing Brazil\'s far-right president Jair Bolsonaro dressed up as Chapulin Colorado — a character from a 1970s Mexican TV show that is hugely popular in Brazil — went viral. In the video, Bolsonaro misquotes his own campaign slogan. <br/> Obviously, the video was satire — Bolsonaro never dressed up as Chapulin Colorado. It was all the work of journalist and digital media editor Bruno Sartori, who used deepfake techniques to combine a clip of Chapulín with another of Bolsonaro speaking in a ceremony in Dallas, United States. Days before, the Brazilian president had been awarded “personality of the year” by the Brazilian-American Chamber of Commerce and, at his acceptance speech, in an apparent attempt to adapt his campaign motto to appease his hosts, he awkwardly said “Brazil and the United States above everything. Brazil above all” (the actual slogan is “Brazil above everything, God above all”). <br/> Deepfake is a machine-learning technique used to alter video content. Once a computer “learns” how a person’s facial expressions work, it\'s then able to replicate it onto someone else\'s body, usually with frightening accuracy. The term “deepfake” is used to refer to both the technique and the videos produced with it.',

      shortDescription: 'Norwegian Air fights for survival. Bondholders will determine its fate.',
      content: 'London (CNN Business)Norwegian Air, Europe\'s third-largest low-cost carrier, is seeking a lifeline from bondholders as it grapples with a cash crunch. <br/> It has asked for two more years to repay its largest outstanding bonds, worth $380 million, and is putting up its lucrative landing slots at London\'s second busiest airport as collateral. "They are managing the crisis as best they can but they are on the verge of a cliff edge," Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska told CNN Business. Norwegian Air has grown rapidly. In 2012, as it prepared to take on the big players in the transatlantic market, it placed an order for 222 aircraft, the biggest in European aviation history. But this aggressive expansion left it with high levels of debt, which means it has little room to move if things go wrong. <br>And plenty has gone wrong. Norwegian Air had to halt flights between Ireland and North America starting on September 15 because of the grounding of all 18 of its Boeing 737 MAX aircraft. <br/> The airline\'s stock has plunged by 65% this year. And in July, CEO and founder Bjoern Kjos, the company\'s largest shareholder, stepped down. It is still looking for a permanent replacement. <br/> Payment delays from credit card companies reduced its working capital by some 4 billion Norwegian kroner ($439 million) in the second quarter of 2019, compared to the same period last year, Norwegian Air said on Monday. <br/> That wiped out $353 million it raised by issuing new shares in March, as well as the proceeds from the recent sale of a stake in a Norwegian bank, which netted it 934 million Norwegian kroner ($102.6 million). It also earned $127 million from the sale of some aircraft this year.',

      content: 'Before Boris Johnson was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, he was mayor of London. And while he\'d never held a senior government position before he was elected in 2008, he wasted no time securing a lasting legacy through a series of design and architectural projects that can be spotted across the capital. <br/> In his eight years in City Hall, Johnson commissioned a tangled red steel tower in London\'s Olympic Village, built the world\'s most expensive cable car high over the Thames river, ordered new-look London buses, and launched a fleet of thousands of pay-as-you-ride rental bikes, dubbed by Londoners "Boris bikes." <br/> According to design writer and critic Douglas Murphy, author of "Nincompoopolis: The Follies of Boris Johnson," Johnson undeniably embraced design as a way to enhance "brand Boris," a combination of bumbling humor and English eccentricity that has propelled him to Downing Street. <br/> For Murphy, Johnson\'s legacy in London amounts to "some of the most remarkably odd public works anywhere in the world in recent years." <br/> "Ranging from architecture to public art to transport, they rank amongst the stupidest, most ill-conceived works of design I\'ve seen in my life," Murphy wrote, "a series of whimsical follies stunning not only for the shallowness of their conception, but also for the sheer fact that the unstoppable will of Johnson managed to make so many of them happen." <br/> The landmarks Johnson added to the London skyline -- the tower known as the ArcelorMittal Orbit and the cable cars officially called the Emirates Air Line -- are hardly the capital\'s most popular attractions. Both languish in the shadow of more popular sites on London\'s tourist circuit, with the Orbit tower carrying more than £12 million ($15 million) in debt and the Air Line\'s future uncertain beyond 2021 when the Emirates\' sponsorship ends.Johnson also boasts a list of grand designs that remain unrealized: a pedestrian "Garden bridge" over the Thames (canceled soon after he left City Hall), a concept for airport on an island on the river Thames, and an oft-forgotten billionaire-backed attempt to rebuild the Victorian Crystal Palace. <br/> Johnson, who last week asked the Queen to suspend the UK\'s Parliament in support of his plans for a swift Brexit arrangement, doesn\'t appear to be short on big, unconventional ideas. But since the end of his second term as mayor three years ago, critics have savaged his enthusiasm for spectacular initiatives with questionable benefit to the public, and for creating a gilded city for a global elite, while allowing rough sleeping to double. <br/> Talking to CNN, Peter Murray, the founder or the London Festival of Architecture and chief curator of the independent organization New London Architecture, defended the Emirates cable car in Greenwich, east London, as an elegant structure and one of the best views of the city. But he damned the nearby steel tower, designed by artist Anish Kapoor for the former Olympic Park, as a "bauble of questionable taste." <br/> The total cost to taxpayers of these high-visibility initiatives exceeded £940 million ($1 billion), and delivered dubious benefit to Londoners, according to an analysis by The Guardian newspaper. A City Hall report revealed a list of failings that led to $56 million (£46 million) of public money being spent on the Garden Bridge, which Johnson later said he could not remember why he had signed off. <br> Last week, campaigner Will Jennings and a former Garden Bridge-backer secured legal funding to assess whether Johnson can be sued for breaching responsibilities as trustees by running up bills, in the latest calls to hold the former mayor accountable for the failed project. <br/> Murphy said he is intrigued by the "kind of personality" that allowed Johnson to secure backing for so many glitzy spectacles, in a city where "faceless business, faceless bureaucracy, endless procurement and tendering processes" are the norm. But in an interview with CNN, the writer held no punches on the legacy Johnson left behind. <br/> "From his mayorship we learned that Johnson is obsessed with his own public image, and has no patience for the detail of governance," Murphy said. "He gave off a strong impression that \'rules are for little people,\' and showed serious disregard for rules of procurement and financing. He was spectacularly and unapologetically pro-rich, and did almost nothing to improve the day to day experience of life in the city." <br/> Murphy is not alone in attempting to understand what these leftover monuments say about Johnson\'s character. <br/> At the end of his term as mayor in May 2016, London\'s daily newspaper The Evening Standard (today edited by Johnson\'s former fellow Conservative Party MP George Osborne, who stood down from the Conservative party in 2017) asked Londoners what the legacy would be for the man already expected to fight for national leadership. <br/> Public figures from British artist Grayson Perry, to transport expert Christian Wolmar praised the segregated cycle "superhighways" and credited him with overseeing the expansion of rail infrastructure to London\'s outer boroughs. <br/> Conversely, Deyan Sudjic, director of London\'s Design Museum, chastised Johnson for approving the construction of more than 100 skyscrapers across the historically low-rise city. "Having stuffed up London, he seems bent equally casually on doing the same to Britain as a whole by persuading us to leave the European Union," he\'s quoted saying in the Evening Standard. <br/> By this point two of his other projects had already undergone significant public criticism. The Orbit tower, for racking up millions in debt, even after a gigantic slide was added by artist Carsten Höller. The hybrid-diesel routemaster, designed by Johnson\'s favorite designer Thomas Heatherwick, was criticized for incubating scorching temperatures on its windowless upper deck (earning the moniker the "Roastmaster"). <br/> More recently, windows have since been added to some of the buses, but future orders have been canceled in favor of newer, zero-emissions models. Murray, however, defended the Heatherwick designed bus,calling it "an elegant addition to London streets." <br/> The bikes -- now competing with rival rental schemes -- seem to be the one widely praised project. They are also the initiative most enduringly linked to Johnson\'s personal brand. <br/> Murphy says these "monuments to his lack of imagination" show what a politician known, above all, for bluster leaves behind when the dust settles. <br/> "Now that Johnson has what he\'s always wanted, we can expect him to aim for historic glory," said Murphy. <br/> Whether Johnson will bring any further designs to Britain remains to be seen. But, his legacy, for now, is one that divides opinion.',
